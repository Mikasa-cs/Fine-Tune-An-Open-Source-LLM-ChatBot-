# 🤖 Fine-Tuned Chatbot using LLMs

This project demonstrates **fine-tuning in Large Language Models (LLMs)** using a user-friendly web interface. It allows users to log in, chat with a fine-tuned model, and review their chat history saved securely in a backend system.

## 📘 What is Fine-Tuning?

Fine-tuning is a process in **transfer learning** where a pre-trained model is adapted to a specific task or domain by continuing the training on a smaller, specialized dataset.

Benefits:
- Improves model performance in specific domains (e.g., legal, medical)
- Requires fewer data and resources than training from scratch
- Enhances response quality for niche use cases
